<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>This project was built with performance and minimalism in mind. 
That meant pure HTML and CSS. No Js, frameworks, or shiny new stuff. Here is a list of everything that went into this site:</p>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Parcel (bundler)</li>
<li>Netlify (Build & Deploy tools including CICD integration with GitHub)</li>

<h3>Results:</h3>
<li>Final bundle size: ~8.59 kB </li>
<li>Local build time: ~1.47s </li>
<li>Average Netlify build and deploy time: ~26.7s</li>
